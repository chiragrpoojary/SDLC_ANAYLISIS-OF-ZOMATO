## Problem Statement
The project aims to analyze the *software development lifecycle (SDLC)* of a real-world system by conducting a comparative study of process models and their impact on requirements management.

## Case Study: Zomato
Zomato operates as an online platform for food delivery, restaurant discovery, and table reservations. The platform supports restaurant searches, customer reviews, online ordering, and personalized recommendations.

## Software Process Models
The study compares three major software process models:

### 1. Incremental Development Model
- *Pros:* Fast deployment, adaptive to changes, continuous updates.  
- *Cons:* Higher long-term maintenance costs.  
- *Application to Zomato:* Enables regular feature updates and real-time user feedback integration.

### 2. Spiral Model
- *Pros:* Risk assessment at each stage, strong security, iterative improvements.  
- *Cons:* High initial costs, longer development time.  
- *Application to Zomato:* Ensures secure and scalable development while mitigating risks.

### 3. Waterfall Model
- *Pros:* Structured approach, detailed documentation, low initial costs.  
- *Cons:* Rigid, difficult to modify, late testing.  
- *Application to Zomato:* Best suited for core infrastructure and compliance features.

### *Comparison Table*
| Aspect             | Waterfall Model  | Incremental Model | Spiral Model  |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| *Approach*       | Linear sequence | Develops in parts | Iterative with risk analysis |
| *Flexibility*    | Low             | Medium           | High         |
| *Risk Management* | Minimal        | Moderate        | High         |
| *User Involvement* | Low           | Medium         | High         |

## Requirements Engineering
### *Functional Requirements*
- Users should be able to *search restaurants* using filters (location, menu, ratings).
- *Online food ordering system* with a seamless checkout and secure payment.
- *Restaurant management panel* for updating menus and pricing.
- *Personalized recommendations* based on past orders and preferences.
- *Review and rating system* for restaurants and dishes.

### *Non-Functional Requirements*
- Response time should be *under 2 seconds* for critical operations.
- The platform should be *scalable* to handle peak traffic efficiently.
- *Security* measures including encryption and authentication.
- *Regulatory compliance* with food safety and digital transaction policies.

## Challenges & Solutions
| *Challenge* | *Solution* |
|--------------|-------------|
| Evolving user requirements | Agile methodology with iterative updates |
| Scalability & performance | Cloud-based infrastructure with load balancing |
| Security & compliance | Data encryption, access control, and periodic audits |
| Multi-region regulations | Automated compliance monitoring |

## Additional SDLC Considerations
### *Agile Methodology*
- Enhances collaboration with stakeholders.
- Faster feature deployment.
- Adapts quickly to market trends and user feedback.

### *DevOps Practices*
- *CI/CD Pipelines*: Automates software deployment.
- *Infrastructure as Code (IaC)*: Ensures scalable and consistent infrastructure.

### *Emerging Technologies*
- *Artificial Intelligence (AI):* Smart recommendations, fraud detection.
- *Internet of Things (IoT):* Real-time tracking, automated kitchen management.
- *Blockchain:* Secure transactions, tamper-proof customer reviews.

## Conclusion
The *Incremental Development Model* is the most suitable for Zomato, as it supports continuous feature updates while balancing risk and cost. A combination of *Agile & DevOps* enhances flexibility and speed. By integrating *AI, IoT, and Blockchain*, Zomato can ensure a secure, efficient, and scalable platform.
